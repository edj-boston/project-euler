Project Euler
=============

These are answers to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems in various languages. The intent is to learn the syntax and control structures in each specific language, brush up on algorithms and time complexity, and stay sharp on application performance.


[Golang](go)
------
[Go](https://golang.org/) is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. Go is an open source project developed by a team at Google and many contributors from the open source community. It is distributed under a BSD-style license.


[JavaScript](javascript)
----------
[JavaScript](http://www.ecmascript.org/) is a dynamic computer programming language. It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed.[5] It is also being used in server-side network programming with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), game development and the creation of desktop and mobile applications.
